# cub3D

42 school patner project for which we created a oldschool 3D raycasting game.

## Installation
git clone git@github.com:wivdvo/cube3d.git cub3D  
cd cub3D  
Make  

## Usage
Run with ./cub3D.  
Move with W, A, S and D.  
Move camera with left and right arrow keys.  

The Map is created in file.cub.  
In this file a path to a .xpm img has to be specified for all 4 directions(norht, east, west and south).  
Also a color for the floor and the roof has to be added.  
After this information you can add the map.  
Walls are '1' empty space is '0' and either 'N', 'E', 'W' or 'S' to place the player and specify in wich direction to spawn.  

The map has to be encased in walls and there can only be one player!
